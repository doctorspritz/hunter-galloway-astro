They really know the lending industry and products and were able to help navigate us through our mortgage. They helped us through the process and kept us updated regularly until our mortgage was approved. The whole process of getting the approval was very quick / done in a matter of days. Also, friendly service and answered all of our questions quickly. Thank you to the Hunter Galloway team.",
