                            <p>As a medical professional you are able to borrow much higher amounts than the general public. Doctors, dentists, and allied health professionals have a great reputation with banks thanks to a high earning potential and a low risk of default.</p>
                            <p>Your exact borrowing capacity depends on your unique financial situation, so it’s best to talk to one of our expert mortgage brokers to find out exactly how much you can borrow.</p>

                                <li>Borrow up to 100% of the property’s value and pay no LMI (slightly harder lending criteria apply)</li>
                                <li>Borrow up to 90% of the property’s value and pay no LMI (largest range of lenders, less strict criteria)</li>
                                <li>Borrow up to $5 million to purchase a home to live in, or investment property</li>

                            <p>In other words, if you are buying a $1 million home, you do not need any deposit and only require some savings to cover stamp duty costs.</p>
                            <p>If the property is valued over $5 million and above, we have access to lenders and banks that will review your situation on a case by case basis</p>

                            <p>Yes you are! Self-employed dentists are eligible for <a href="/avoid-lenders-mortgage-insurance/">home loans without LMI</a> and your tax returns will be evidence to prove this. However, if this isn’t a possible document then invoices can be used as evidence of income. Lenders are looking at your ability to repay the loan and it certainly isn’t the first time a self-employed professional has asked for a loan.</p>

                            <p>However, due to this, they can sometimes be looked at with an air of caution by lenders, as the income level is not stable and there’s a higher chance of default. A way to get around this is to show regular and stable income for an extended period. Anything from 2 years + will cover this.</p>

                            <p>In order to receive benefits that dentists recieve such as waived Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI) or interest rate discounts, you need to be a member of the <a href="https://www.ada.org.au/">Australian Dental Association (ADA)</a> or the <a href="https://www.adc.org.au/"> Australian Dental Council (ADC)</a>.</p>
