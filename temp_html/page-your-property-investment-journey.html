They helped us from getting the loan, searching the property till finalizing our home. Alex answered the questions each time when I ask him something even it wasn't relating to a loan.We couldn’t be happier with their service and highly recommend them to anyone needing a mortgage broker.</div>

                  A mortgage broker is a consultant that can help you with finding a home loan, or mortgage usually from their panel of lenders. Once the right home loan has

                  A mortgage broker acts on your behalf to arrange a home loan through a bank or lender. Australian banks and lenders have different policies and loan
                  requirements, and it is a brokers job to find a loan from one of these parties that fit with your individual situation.

                  Mortgage Brokers can help find the right home loan for any situation, from purchasing your first home to buying an investment property all the way to
                  refinancing your mortgage to a better interest rate.

              <div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
                <p>
                  An Independent Mortgage Broker in Brisbane is a broker that is not subjected to outside authority. In other words, they should technically be charging a fee
                  for their services and not be paid commissions by the banks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In Australia, brokers are not technically independent. Brokers use an aggregator, who provide access to all of the loans offered by the banks and lenders.
                  We are paid a commission from the banks for providing them with a home loan.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But there is still a difference between independently owned mortgage brokers, and those owned by banks. Mortgage brokers who are owned by the banks are
                  influenced to recommend the loans from the banks that own them.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Using a mortgage broker gives you many more options than going directly through a bank. Individual banks can only offer you the small number of loans that
                  they have. We have access to over 40 banks in Australia, so we can find you the right lender and the right loan.
                </p>
                <p>The best mortgage brokers can help you through their intimate knowledge of credit policy, making the home loan process quick, easy and stress-free.</p>
                <p>
                  We work with a wide range of borrowers, from <a href="/first-home-buyer-loans/" plerdy-tracking-id="44202923501">first home owners</a>,

                </p>
                <p>
                  Through our intimate bank credit knowledge, we can find ‘secret’ policy exceptions to get approvals for applications that would normally get declined,
                  including no deposit <a href="/guarantor-home-loan/" plerdy-tracking-id="34484483701">guarantor home loans</a> and <a href="/unusual-employment-loan/" plerdy-tracking-id="56036451101">unusual employment loans.</a>

                <p>
                  We also have very strong relationships with the credit teams and key staff at the banks meaning we are also in a good position to get the very best interest
                  rates for you, ensuring you can secure a better deal. Often this means a cheaper variable or fixed interest rates, or rebates from the bank to cover the costs to

              <h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title" plerdy-tracking-id="16283344901">What is the difference between fixed and variable rates?</h5>
              <div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
                <p>
                  A fixed rate mortgage means that you 'lock in' an interest rate for either a two-, three-, or five-year fixed period. While you're on that fixed rate, your
                  loan repayment will not change, even if interest rates go up.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The main benefit of a fixed rate mortgage is security. You know what your monthly repayments will be and you don't have to worry about interest rates rising
                  or falling.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A variable rate mortgage means that your mortgage repayments will change based on current interest rates. If the interest rates go up, then your repayments
                  will increase. If interest rates drop, so do your repayments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The main benefit of a variable rate mortgage is flexibility. A variable rate home loan will allow you to make extra repayments without penalties and you
                  also have the option of extra facilities like offset accounts.

                  Managing risk is all about understanding your situation, and borrowing the right amount of money. Borrowing the absolute maximum amount of money possible
                  can be a problem if your financial or living circumstances change, so it's important to get the assistance of a mortgage broker to help make sure that
                  you're borrowing the right amount of money.

                <p>
                  The length of a mortgage application depends on a lot of different factors, including the complexity of the application and the lender that you're using.
                  Simple applications with the most responsive lenders can be very quick. More complex applications or some of the slower lenders can take a bit more time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you are purchasing a property it's very common for us to have our finance approved within 14 days, or 2 weeks - sometimes less if you have tight finance
                  timeframes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We will give you an idea of the expected time for your application when we submit it to the lenders, and keep you posted every step of the way. As a general
                  guide, though, most applications are settled within a month (and many are settled much quicker than that).
