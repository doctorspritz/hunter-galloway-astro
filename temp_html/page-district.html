              lifestyle: "Bisected by Samford Road (running east-west) and Wardell Street (north-south), Inner Northern Suburb is remarkably central to everything the inner-north west has to offer. Samford Road runs out to the beautiful Samford Valley and the D'Aguilar National Park (via Brookside Shopping Center, if you're so inclined), or quickly into the city, via Newmarket and Kelvin Grove. Wardell Street links the inner-western suburbs, making it easy to pop to Ashgrove, Paddington and Toowong (or much further north towards the Sunshine Coast). There are two major bus terminals in this neighborhood (on Wardell Street and at the Enoggera train station), and two train stations on the Ferny Grove line (Enoggera and Gaythorne). Inner Northern Suburb is also distinguished by its easy access to quality schools, with a number of well-regarded private and public schools within its catchment. Families move here to be close to schools. With beautiful homes, tree-lined streets, and educational and entertainment opportunities, Inner Northern Suburb is first in its class for family fun and inner-city convenience",

              lifestyle: "Bisected by Samford Road (running east-west) and Wardell Street (north-south), Inner Northern Suburb is remarkably central to everything the inner-north west has to offer. Samford Road runs out to the beautiful Samford Valley and the D'Aguilar National Park (via Brookside Shopping Center, if you're so inclined), or quickly into the city, via Newmarket and Kelvin Grove. Wardell Street links the inner-western suburbs, making it easy to pop to Ashgrove, Paddington and Toowong (or much further north towards the Sunshine Coast). There are two major bus terminals in this neighborhood (on Wardell Street and at the Enoggera train station), and two train stations on the Ferny Grove line (Enoggera and Gaythorne). Inner Northern Suburb is also distinguished by its easy access to quality schools, with a number of well-regarded private and public schools within its catchment. Families move here to be close to schools. With beautiful homes, tree-lined streets, and educational and entertainment opportunities, Inner Northern Suburb is first in its class for family fun and inner-city convenience",

Inner Eastern Suburbs has a historical trail which was designed on behalf of the Pinkenba Community Association and the Port of Brisbane with help from Brisbane City Council Neighbourhood planning team. Numerous development projects were proposed for the area, including residential developments and an immigration detention centre. The suburb contains a small number of detached houses (primarily of weatherboard construction), local store, pub and industrial precincts. Life is cooler here — in both senses of the word. Inner Eastern Suburb is bordered on two sides by the Brisbane River, so afternoon breezes regularly chase the summer heat away. The homes here take advantage of the river-aspect, with the majority of homes having broad verandahs, balconies and bay windows. Renovated Queenslanders, colonial and post-war cottages and a few boutique apartment blocks all line the streets, nestled behind large jacaranda and fig trees. Inner Eastern Suburbs has everything you need for a great lifestyle — food, shopping, entertainment and fun for the entire family — all without leaving its leafy streets. Sure, you might have to force yourself to leave to go to work on Monday, but you’ll always be happy to come home",

              lifestyle: "Inner Southern Suburbs is a glorious place in the inner suburbs of Brisbane. The views of the city at night are really pretty and it's a convenient spot to almost anywhere in Brisbane. West End is also right next door with its plethora of boutique fashion and lifestyle shops. A comfortable walk to West End and Southbank/City. Loads of restaurants to choose from and leafy parks on the river to kickback and relax. At the highest point of the Inner Southern Suburbs is a small park which boasts excellent views of the city and surrounding hills. It's particularly popular during summer due to the cool breezes. Lyons Playground Park, also known as Paradise Park, is a well equipped small park that also has a community garden. The Brydon Street park leads into a gully down to the river and is what remains of the bushland that was subject to protest in 2002 People who live in Inner Southern Suburbs are intensely proud of their community and passionate about their village lifestyle. Families, students or well-heeled professionals — they all love their suburb and tend to shop, eat and drink locally. The people in the street are very friendly and its lovely to be able to stop and have a chat. No-one in this suburb tolerates bad coffee, and luckily they don’t have to. Locals and aficionados alike will tell you that some of Brisbane’s best coffees, breakfasts, books and record stores are found on Boundary Street, Vulture Street or Hardgrave Road. Inner Southern Suburbs also boasts one of the biggest farmers’ markets in Brisbane, and a festival line-up that includes the Greek festival, Paniyiri, Australia’s largest cultural festival. When the best bands aren’t playing in Brisbane’s Fortitude Valley, they’re playing here. You can catch a gig most nights of the week, with an emphasis on intimate venues and indie performers",

              lifestyle: "Inner Southern Suburbs is a glorious place in the inner suburbs of Brisbane. The views of the city at night are really pretty and it's a convenient spot to almost anywhere in Brisbane. West End is also right next door with its plethora of boutique fashion and lifestyle shops. A comfortable walk to West End and Southbank/City. Loads of restaurants to choose from and leafy parks on the river to kickback and relax. At the highest point of the Inner Southern Suburbs is a small park which boasts excellent views of the city and surrounding hills. It's particularly popular during summer due to the cool breezes. Lyons Playground Park, also known as Paradise Park, is a well equipped small park that also has a community garden. The Brydon Street park leads into a gully down to the river and is what remains of the bushland that was subject to protest in 2002 People who live in Inner Southern Suburbs are intensely proud of their community and passionate about their village lifestyle. Families, students or well-heeled professionals — they all love their suburb and tend to shop, eat and drink locally. The people in the street are very friendly and its lovely to be able to stop and have a chat. No-one in this suburb tolerates bad coffee, and luckily they don’t have to. Locals and aficionados alike will tell you that some of Brisbane’s best coffees, breakfasts, books and record stores are found on Boundary Street, Vulture Street or Hardgrave Road. Inner Southern Suburbs also boasts one of the biggest farmers’ markets in Brisbane, and a festival line-up that includes the Greek festival, Paniyiri, Australia’s largest cultural festival. When the best bands aren’t playing in Brisbane’s Fortitude Valley, they’re playing here. You can catch a gig most nights of the week, with an emphasis on intimate venues and indie performers",

              lifestyle: "Inner Southern Suburbs is a glorious place in the inner suburbs of Brisbane. The views of the city at night are really pretty and it's a convenient spot to almost anywhere in Brisbane. West End is also right next door with its plethora of boutique fashion and lifestyle shops. A comfortable walk to West End and Southbank/City. Loads of restaurants to choose from and leafy parks on the river to kickback and relax. At the highest point of the Inner Southern Suburbs is a small park which boasts excellent views of the city and surrounding hills. It's particularly popular during summer due to the cool breezes. Lyons Playground Park, also known as Paradise Park, is a well equipped small park that also has a community garden. The Brydon Street park leads into a gully down to the river and is what remains of the bushland that was subject to protest in 2002 People who live in Inner Southern Suburbs are intensely proud of their community and passionate about their village lifestyle. Families, students or well-heeled professionals — they all love their suburb and tend to shop, eat and drink locally. The people in the street are very friendly and its lovely to be able to stop and have a chat. No-one in this suburb tolerates bad coffee, and luckily they don’t have to. Locals and aficionados alike will tell you that some of Brisbane’s best coffees, breakfasts, books and record stores are found on Boundary Street, Vulture Street or Hardgrave Road. Inner Southern Suburbs also boasts one of the biggest farmers’ markets in Brisbane, and a festival line-up that includes the Greek festival, Paniyiri, Australia’s largest cultural festival. When the best bands aren’t playing in Brisbane’s Fortitude Valley, they’re playing here. You can catch a gig most nights of the week, with an emphasis on intimate venues and indie performers",

              lifestyle: "Inner Southern Suburbs is a glorious place in the inner suburbs of Brisbane. The views of the city at night are really pretty and it's a convenient spot to almost anywhere in Brisbane. West End is also right next door with its plethora of boutique fashion and lifestyle shops. A comfortable walk to West End and Southbank/City. Loads of restaurants to choose from and leafy parks on the river to kickback and relax. At the highest point of the Inner Southern Suburbs is a small park which boasts excellent views of the city and surrounding hills. It's particularly popular during summer due to the cool breezes. Lyons Playground Park, also known as Paradise Park, is a well equipped small park that also has a community garden. The Brydon Street park leads into a gully down to the river and is what remains of the bushland that was subject to protest in 2002 People who live in Inner Southern Suburbs are intensely proud of their community and passionate about their village lifestyle. Families, students or well-heeled professionals — they all love their suburb and tend to shop, eat and drink locally. The people in the street are very friendly and its lovely to be able to stop and have a chat. No-one in this suburb tolerates bad coffee, and luckily they don’t have to. Locals and aficionados alike will tell you that some of Brisbane’s best coffees, breakfasts, books and record stores are found on Boundary Street, Vulture Street or Hardgrave Road. Inner Southern Suburbs also boasts one of the biggest farmers’ markets in Brisbane, and a festival line-up that includes the Greek festival, Paniyiri, Australia’s largest cultural festival. When the best bands aren’t playing in Brisbane’s Fortitude Valley, they’re playing here. You can catch a gig most nights of the week, with an emphasis on intimate venues and indie performers",

It may be due to the Italian heritage, but people from all over Brisbane flock to Inner Western Suburb for good food. Whether it's an organic breakfast, a hearty lunch, or a gourmet dinner, locals and guests alike love to eat here. Shopping is also a local pastime: Given Terrace has specialty shops and boutiques, while La Trobe Terrace a Mecca is for antiques, secondhand and vintage lovers. Paddington is bordered by Petrie Terrace (a well-established entertainment district) on the city side, the beautiful Red Hill on its northern edge, and Rosalie's gourmet village is just down the hill. The Queensland Government House, built in 1911, is located on Fernburg Road in Upper Paddington. Hilly, charming and distinctive Brisbane, the Inner Western Suburbs is almost exclusively residential, with a narrow strip of cafes, shops and offices running down Given and La Trobe terraces. Large, historic homes with many rooms are ideal for living together as well as family homes, so there is plenty of both. Over the past 30 years, wealthy professionals have bought up workers' cottages and renovated them to their heart's content. This area is one of the oldest and most charismatic suburbs in Brisbane. It has a special heritage atmosphere and a cottage lifestyle that is loved by professionals, families and students alike",

Students and interns alike have always loved the area's large dorms, but these lavish homes are increasingly filled with families and renovators looking to enjoy everything the modern Inner Western Suburb has to offer: gourmet food, boutiques, and a short two-kilometer walk (or bus) to the City. It may be due to the Italian heritage, but people from all over Brisbane flock to Inner Western Suburb for good food. Whether it's an organic breakfast, a hearty lunch, or a gourmet dinner, locals and guests alike love to eat here. Shopping is also a local pastime: Given Terrace has specialty shops and boutiques, while La Trobe Terrace a Mecca is for antiques, secondhand and vintage lovers. Paddington is bordered by Petrie Terrace (a well-established entertainment district) on the city side, the beautiful Red Hill on its northern edge, and Rosalie's gourmet village is just down the hill. The Queensland Government House, built in 1911, is located on Fernburg Road in Upper Paddington. Hilly, charming and distinctive Brisbane, the Inner Western Suburbs is almost exclusively residential, with a narrow strip of cafes, shops and offices running down Given and La Trobe terraces. Large, historic homes with many rooms are ideal for living together as well as family homes, so there is plenty of both. Over the past 30 years, wealthy professionals have bought up workers' cottages and renovated them to their heart's content. This area is one of the oldest and most charismatic suburbs in Brisbane. It has a special heritage atmosphere and a cottage lifestyle that is loved by professionals, families and students alike",

Most parts of the area are within walking distance of Sandgate and Bay, but no Sandgate or Shorncliff prices. The area is safe and typically suburban, with some great little hidden cafes, shopping malls and a large selection of restaurants and bars. The area was once a holiday destination for Brisbans and a quiet retreat. But now that commuting to work is easier than ever, professionals and families enjoy marine life year round, bringing with them a passion for outdoor living and a cosmopolitan coolness. The local demographic is a mixture of old and young, middle, lower middle and upper working class, with a growing number of ascendants and prosperous young families buying the suburbs with their charming post-war homes. , cottages and residents of Queensland. This area is an excellent base and suburb where everyone can feel comfortable and “at home”. Groceries and other purchases can be done in Ascot, Clayfield (3-5 minutes), Chermside (5-8 minutes), DFO (3-6 minutes), Toombule (2-4 minutes) or Nanda Village (1-3 minutes). Highway access is super fast and offers a real advantage — a day trip or weekend up or down the coast, or north to Shorncliffe, Sandgate, Redcliffe or Bribie Island, or east to Bulimba, Manley, Wellington Point or Cleveland becomes fast and just. Food is a key feature of Radcliffe's lifestyle. It has a strong cafe culture and serves the best coffee outside of Brisbane. Local bistros, ice cream, fish and chips are also popular, but by far the biggest treat is the fresh seafood from the docks in Scarborough",

              lifestyle: "The location of North Eastern Suburbs allows for the perfect trilogy with excellent transport links, proximity to the ocean and beautiful large housing estates. Most parts of the area are within walking distance of Sandgate and Bay, but no Sandgate or Shorncliff prices. The area is safe and typically suburban, with some great little hidden cafes, shopping malls and a large selection of restaurants and bars. The area was once a holiday destination for Brisbans and a quiet retreat. But now that commuting to work is easier than ever, professionals and families enjoy marine life year round, bringing with them a passion for outdoor living and a cosmopolitan coolness. The local demographic is a mixture of old and young, middle, lower middle and upper working class, with a growing number of ascendants and prosperous young families buying the suburbs with their charming post-war homes. , cottages and residents of Queensland. This area is an excellent base and suburb where everyone can feel comfortable and “at home”. Groceries and other purchases can be done in Ascot, Clayfield (3-5 minutes), Chermside (5-8 minutes), DFO (3-6 minutes), Toombule (2-4 minutes) or Nanda Village (1-3 minutes). Highway access is super fast and offers a real advantage — a day trip or weekend up or down the coast, or north to Shorncliffe, Sandgate, Redcliffe or Bribie Island, or east to Bulimba, Manley, Wellington Point or Cleveland becomes fast and just. Food is a key feature of Radcliffe's lifestyle. It has a strong cafe culture and serves the best coffee outside of Brisbane. Local bistros, ice cream, fish and chips are also popular, but by far the biggest treat is the fresh seafood from the docks in Scarborough",

              lifestyle: "The location of North Eastern Suburbs allows for the perfect trilogy with excellent transport links, proximity to the ocean and beautiful large housing estates. Most parts of the area are within walking distance of Sandgate and Bay, but no Sandgate or Shorncliff prices. The area is safe and typically suburban, with some great little hidden cafes, shopping malls and a large selection of restaurants and bars. The area was once a holiday destination for Brisbans and a quiet retreat. But now that commuting to work is easier than ever, professionals and families enjoy marine life year round, bringing with them a passion for outdoor living and a cosmopolitan coolness. The local demographic is a mixture of old and young, middle, lower middle and upper working class, with a growing number of ascendants and prosperous young families buying the suburbs with their charming post-war homes. , cottages and residents of Queensland. This area is an excellent base and suburb where everyone can feel comfortable and “at home”. Groceries and other purchases can be done in Ascot, Clayfield (3-5 minutes), Chermside (5-8 minutes), DFO (3-6 minutes), Toombule (2-4 minutes) or Nanda Village (1-3 minutes). Highway access is super fast and offers a real advantage — a day trip or weekend up or down the coast, or north to Shorncliffe, Sandgate, Redcliffe or Bribie Island, or east to Bulimba, Manley, Wellington Point or Cleveland becomes fast and just. Food is a key feature of Radcliffe's lifestyle. It has a strong cafe culture and serves the best coffee outside of Brisbane. Local bistros, ice cream, fish and chips are also popular, but by far the biggest treat is the fresh seafood from the docks in Scarborough",

              lifestyle: "The location of North Eastern Suburbs allows for the perfect trilogy with excellent transport links, proximity to the ocean and beautiful large housing estates. Most parts of the area are within walking distance of Sandgate and Bay, but no Sandgate or Shorncliff prices. The area is safe and typically suburban, with some great little hidden cafes, shopping malls and a large selection of restaurants and bars. The area was once a holiday destination for Brisbans and a quiet retreat. But now that commuting to work is easier than ever, professionals and families enjoy marine life year round, bringing with them a passion for outdoor living and a cosmopolitan coolness. The local demographic is a mixture of old and young, middle, lower middle and upper working class, with a growing number of ascendants and prosperous young families buying the suburbs with their charming post-war homes. , cottages and residents of Queensland. This area is an excellent base and suburb where everyone can feel comfortable and “at home”. Groceries and other purchases can be done in Ascot, Clayfield (3-5 minutes), Chermside (5-8 minutes), DFO (3-6 minutes), Toombule (2-4 minutes) or Nanda Village (1-3 minutes). Highway access is super fast and offers a real advantage — a day trip or weekend up or down the coast, or north to Shorncliffe, Sandgate, Redcliffe or Bribie Island, or east to Bulimba, Manley, Wellington Point or Cleveland becomes fast and just. Food is a key feature of Radcliffe's lifestyle. It has a strong cafe culture and serves the best coffee outside of Brisbane. Local bistros, ice cream, fish and chips are also popular, but by far the biggest treat is the fresh seafood from the docks in Scarborough",

              lifestyle: "The location of North Eastern Suburbs allows for the perfect trilogy with excellent transport links, proximity to the ocean and beautiful large housing estates. Most parts of the area are within walking distance of Sandgate and Bay, but no Sandgate or Shorncliff prices. The area is safe and typically suburban, with some great little hidden cafes, shopping malls and a large selection of restaurants and bars. The area was once a holiday destination for Brisbans and a quiet retreat. But now that commuting to work is easier than ever, professionals and families enjoy marine life year round, bringing with them a passion for outdoor living and a cosmopolitan coolness. The local demographic is a mixture of old and young, middle, lower middle and upper working class, with a growing number of ascendants and prosperous young families buying the suburbs with their charming post-war homes. , cottages and residents of Queensland. This area is an excellent base and suburb where everyone can feel comfortable and “at home”. Groceries and other purchases can be done in Ascot, Clayfield (3-5 minutes), Chermside (5-8 minutes), DFO (3-6 minutes), Toombule (2-4 minutes) or Nanda Village (1-3 minutes). Highway access is super fast and offers a real advantage — a day trip or weekend up or down the coast, or north to Shorncliffe, Sandgate, Redcliffe or Bribie Island, or east to Bulimba, Manley, Wellington Point or Cleveland becomes fast and just. Food is a key feature of Radcliffe's lifestyle. It has a strong cafe culture and serves the best coffee outside of Brisbane. Local bistros, ice cream, fish and chips are also popular, but by far the biggest treat is the fresh seafood from the docks in Scarborough",

Southern Suburbs is a wonderful suburb, great easy access to Brisbane City and surrounded by amazing parklands, excellent schools, charming cafe's, bars and restaurants. No matter where you are in the suburb you are never far from everything you could possibly need. There are enough restaurants for a good way of lifestyle, cafes and bars along both Holland Road and Logan Road to keep us entertained and good bus access into town or South Bank (only ~6 km away). Good access to motorways and public transport including the new train station. Doctors, schools, babysitting are all nearby. Still plenty of units with a mix of heritage listed queenslanders, post-war and modern homes. Up towards Cav Road many of these are on elevated spots that catch great breezes and city or suburban views. With 100 businesses located in the Moorvale shopping area on Beaudesert Road, it’s easy to shop and eat locally. The African community has left its mark here too, with grocery stores, hairdressers and Halal butchers meeting the needs of the new locals. New cafes are popping up on street corners to make sure that this neighbourhood is well fed and caffeinated, without having to jump in the car. It's a great place to raise kids, good neighbours. Overall Southern Suburbs has a friendly community spirit where neighbours catch up at the letterbox or for street barbecues. Everyone is willing to lend a hand if one is needed and strangers will greet you while a smile and a “G'day”. There are plenty of parks to walk the dog or take the kids to play with purpose built bike tracks and picturesque pathways through bushland and parks",

              lifestyle: "Overall Southern Suburbs is a sought after place to live. This is a great place to live and over the next few years there should be good capital growth for property owners. Southern Suburbs is a wonderful suburb, great easy access to Brisbane City and surrounded by amazing parklands, excellent schools, charming cafe's, bars and restaurants. No matter where you are in the suburb you are never far from everything you could possibly need. There are enough restaurants for a good way of lifestyle, cafes and bars along both Holland Road and Logan Road to keep us entertained and good bus access into town or South Bank (only ~6 km away). Good access to motorways and public transport including the new train station. Doctors, schools, babysitting are all nearby. Still plenty of units with a mix of heritage listed queenslanders, post-war and modern homes. Up towards Cav Road many of these are on elevated spots that catch great breezes and city or suburban views. With 100 businesses located in the Moorvale shopping area on Beaudesert Road, it’s easy to shop and eat locally. The African community has left its mark here too, with grocery stores, hairdressers and Halal butchers meeting the needs of the new locals. New cafes are popping up on street corners to make sure that this neighbourhood is well fed and caffeinated, without having to jump in the car. It's a great place to raise kids, good neighbours. Overall Southern Suburbs has a friendly community spirit where neighbours catch up at the letterbox or for street barbecues. Everyone is willing to lend a hand if one is needed and strangers will greet you while a smile and a “G'day”. There are plenty of parks to walk the dog or take the kids to play with purpose built bike tracks and picturesque pathways through bushland and parks",

              lifestyle: "Overall Southern Suburbs is a sought after place to live. This is a great place to live and over the next few years there should be good capital growth for property owners. Southern Suburbs is a wonderful suburb, great easy access to Brisbane City and surrounded by amazing parklands, excellent schools, charming cafe's, bars and restaurants. No matter where you are in the suburb you are never far from everything you could possibly need. There are enough restaurants for a good way of lifestyle, cafes and bars along both Holland Road and Logan Road to keep us entertained and good bus access into town or South Bank (only ~6 km away). Good access to motorways and public transport including the new train station. Doctors, schools, babysitting are all nearby. Still plenty of units with a mix of heritage listed queenslanders, post-war and modern homes. Up towards Cav Road many of these are on elevated spots that catch great breezes and city or suburban views. With 100 businesses located in the Moorvale shopping area on Beaudesert Road, it’s easy to shop and eat locally. The African community has left its mark here too, with grocery stores, hairdressers and Halal butchers meeting the needs of the new locals. New cafes are popping up on street corners to make sure that this neighbourhood is well fed and caffeinated, without having to jump in the car. It's a great place to raise kids, good neighbours. Overall Southern Suburbs has a friendly community spirit where neighbours catch up at the letterbox or for street barbecues. Everyone is willing to lend a hand if one is needed and strangers will greet you while a smile and a “G'day”. There are plenty of parks to walk the dog or take the kids to play with purpose built bike tracks and picturesque pathways through bushland and parks",

              lifestyle: "Overall Southern Suburbs is a sought after place to live. This is a great place to live and over the next few years there should be good capital growth for property owners. Southern Suburbs is a wonderful suburb, great easy access to Brisbane City and surrounded by amazing parklands, excellent schools, charming cafe's, bars and restaurants. No matter where you are in the suburb you are never far from everything you could possibly need. There are enough restaurants for a good way of lifestyle, cafes and bars along both Holland Road and Logan Road to keep us entertained and good bus access into town or South Bank (only ~6 km away). Good access to motorways and public transport including the new train station. Doctors, schools, babysitting are all nearby. Still plenty of units with a mix of heritage listed queenslanders, post-war and modern homes. Up towards Cav Road many of these are on elevated spots that catch great breezes and city or suburban views. With 100 businesses located in the Moorvale shopping area on Beaudesert Road, it’s easy to shop and eat locally. The African community has left its mark here too, with grocery stores, hairdressers and Halal butchers meeting the needs of the new locals. New cafes are popping up on street corners to make sure that this neighbourhood is well fed and caffeinated, without having to jump in the car. It's a great place to raise kids, good neighbours. Overall Southern Suburbs has a friendly community spirit where neighbours catch up at the letterbox or for street barbecues. Everyone is willing to lend a hand if one is needed and strangers will greet you while a smile and a “G'day”. There are plenty of parks to walk the dog or take the kids to play with purpose built bike tracks and picturesque pathways through bushland and parks",

              lifestyle: "Overall Southern Suburbs is a sought after place to live. This is a great place to live and over the next few years there should be good capital growth for property owners. Southern Suburbs is a wonderful suburb, great easy access to Brisbane City and surrounded by amazing parklands, excellent schools, charming cafe's, bars and restaurants. No matter where you are in the suburb you are never far from everything you could possibly need. There are enough restaurants for a good way of lifestyle, cafes and bars along both Holland Road and Logan Road to keep us entertained and good bus access into town or South Bank (only ~6 km away). Good access to motorways and public transport including the new train station. Doctors, schools, babysitting are all nearby. Still plenty of units with a mix of heritage listed queenslanders, post-war and modern homes. Up towards Cav Road many of these are on elevated spots that catch great breezes and city or suburban views. With 100 businesses located in the Moorvale shopping area on Beaudesert Road, it’s easy to shop and eat locally. The African community has left its mark here too, with grocery stores, hairdressers and Halal butchers meeting the needs of the new locals. New cafes are popping up on street corners to make sure that this neighbourhood is well fed and caffeinated, without having to jump in the car. It's a great place to raise kids, good neighbours. Overall Southern Suburbs has a friendly community spirit where neighbours catch up at the letterbox or for street barbecues. Everyone is willing to lend a hand if one is needed and strangers will greet you while a smile and a “G'day”. There are plenty of parks to walk the dog or take the kids to play with purpose built bike tracks and picturesque pathways through bushland and parks",

              lifestyle: "Overall Southern Suburbs is a sought after place to live. This is a great place to live and over the next few years there should be good capital growth for property owners. Southern Suburbs is a wonderful suburb, great easy access to Brisbane City and surrounded by amazing parklands, excellent schools, charming cafe's, bars and restaurants. No matter where you are in the suburb you are never far from everything you could possibly need. There are enough restaurants for a good way of lifestyle, cafes and bars along both Holland Road and Logan Road to keep us entertained and good bus access into town or South Bank (only ~6 km away). Good access to motorways and public transport including the new train station. Doctors, schools, babysitting are all nearby. Still plenty of units with a mix of heritage listed queenslanders, post-war and modern homes. Up towards Cav Road many of these are on elevated spots that catch great breezes and city or suburban views. With 100 businesses located in the Moorvale shopping area on Beaudesert Road, it’s easy to shop and eat locally. The African community has left its mark here too, with grocery stores, hairdressers and Halal butchers meeting the needs of the new locals. New cafes are popping up on street corners to make sure that this neighbourhood is well fed and caffeinated, without having to jump in the car. It's a great place to raise kids, good neighbours. Overall Southern Suburbs has a friendly community spirit where neighbours catch up at the letterbox or for street barbecues. Everyone is willing to lend a hand if one is needed and strangers will greet you while a smile and a “G'day”. There are plenty of parks to walk the dog or take the kids to play with purpose built bike tracks and picturesque pathways through bushland and parks",

              lifestyle: "Overall Southern Suburbs is a sought after place to live. This is a great place to live and over the next few years there should be good capital growth for property owners. Southern Suburbs is a wonderful suburb, great easy access to Brisbane City and surrounded by amazing parklands, excellent schools, charming cafe's, bars and restaurants. No matter where you are in the suburb you are never far from everything you could possibly need. There are enough restaurants for a good way of lifestyle, cafes and bars along both Holland Road and Logan Road to keep us entertained and good bus access into town or South Bank (only ~6 km away). Good access to motorways and public transport including the new train station. Doctors, schools, babysitting are all nearby. Still plenty of units with a mix of heritage listed queenslanders, post-war and modern homes. Up towards Cav Road many of these are on elevated spots that catch great breezes and city or suburban views. With 100 businesses located in the Moorvale shopping area on Beaudesert Road, it’s easy to shop and eat locally. The African community has left its mark here too, with grocery stores, hairdressers and Halal butchers meeting the needs of the new locals. New cafes are popping up on street corners to make sure that this neighbourhood is well fed and caffeinated, without having to jump in the car. It's a great place to raise kids, good neighbours. Overall Southern Suburbs has a friendly community spirit where neighbours catch up at the letterbox or for street barbecues. Everyone is willing to lend a hand if one is needed and strangers will greet you while a smile and a “G'day”. There are plenty of parks to walk the dog or take the kids to play with purpose built bike tracks and picturesque pathways through bushland and parks",

              lifestyle: "Overall Southern Suburbs is a sought after place to live. This is a great place to live and over the next few years there should be good capital growth for property owners. Southern Suburbs is a wonderful suburb, great easy access to Brisbane City and surrounded by amazing parklands, excellent schools, charming cafe's, bars and restaurants. No matter where you are in the suburb you are never far from everything you could possibly need. There are enough restaurants for a good way of lifestyle, cafes and bars along both Holland Road and Logan Road to keep us entertained and good bus access into town or South Bank (only ~6 km away). Good access to motorways and public transport including the new train station. Doctors, schools, babysitting are all nearby. Still plenty of units with a mix of heritage listed queenslanders, post-war and modern homes. Up towards Cav Road many of these are on elevated spots that catch great breezes and city or suburban views. With 100 businesses located in the Moorvale shopping area on Beaudesert Road, it’s easy to shop and eat locally. The African community has left its mark here too, with grocery stores, hairdressers and Halal butchers meeting the needs of the new locals. New cafes are popping up on street corners to make sure that this neighbourhood is well fed and caffeinated, without having to jump in the car. It's a great place to raise kids, good neighbours. Overall Southern Suburbs has a friendly community spirit where neighbours catch up at the letterbox or for street barbecues. Everyone is willing to lend a hand if one is needed and strangers will greet you while a smile and a “G'day”. There are plenty of parks to walk the dog or take the kids to play with purpose built bike tracks and picturesque pathways through bushland and parks",

              lifestyle: "Overall Southern Suburbs is a sought after place to live. This is a great place to live and over the next few years there should be good capital growth for property owners. Southern Suburbs is a wonderful suburb, great easy access to Brisbane City and surrounded by amazing parklands, excellent schools, charming cafe's, bars and restaurants. No matter where you are in the suburb you are never far from everything you could possibly need. There are enough restaurants for a good way of lifestyle, cafes and bars along both Holland Road and Logan Road to keep us entertained and good bus access into town or South Bank (only ~6 km away). Good access to motorways and public transport including the new train station. Doctors, schools, babysitting are all nearby. Still plenty of units with a mix of heritage listed queenslanders, post-war and modern homes. Up towards Cav Road many of these are on elevated spots that catch great breezes and city or suburban views. With 100 businesses located in the Moorvale shopping area on Beaudesert Road, it’s easy to shop and eat locally. The African community has left its mark here too, with grocery stores, hairdressers and Halal butchers meeting the needs of the new locals. New cafes are popping up on street corners to make sure that this neighbourhood is well fed and caffeinated, without having to jump in the car. It's a great place to raise kids, good neighbours. Overall Southern Suburbs has a friendly community spirit where neighbours catch up at the letterbox or for street barbecues. Everyone is willing to lend a hand if one is needed and strangers will greet you while a smile and a “G'day”. There are plenty of parks to walk the dog or take the kids to play with purpose built bike tracks and picturesque pathways through bushland and parks",

              lifestyle: "Overall Southern Suburbs is a sought after place to live. This is a great place to live and over the next few years there should be good capital growth for property owners. Southern Suburbs is a wonderful suburb, great easy access to Brisbane City and surrounded by amazing parklands, excellent schools, charming cafe's, bars and restaurants. No matter where you are in the suburb you are never far from everything you could possibly need. There are enough restaurants for a good way of lifestyle, cafes and bars along both Holland Road and Logan Road to keep us entertained and good bus access into town or South Bank (only ~6 km away). Good access to motorways and public transport including the new train station. Doctors, schools, babysitting are all nearby. Still plenty of units with a mix of heritage listed queenslanders, post-war and modern homes. Up towards Cav Road many of these are on elevated spots that catch great breezes and city or suburban views. With 100 businesses located in the Moorvale shopping area on Beaudesert Road, it’s easy to shop and eat locally. The African community has left its mark here too, with grocery stores, hairdressers and Halal butchers meeting the needs of the new locals. New cafes are popping up on street corners to make sure that this neighbourhood is well fed and caffeinated, without having to jump in the car. It's a great place to raise kids, good neighbours. Overall Southern Suburbs has a friendly community spirit where neighbours catch up at the letterbox or for street barbecues. Everyone is willing to lend a hand if one is needed and strangers will greet you while a smile and a “G'day”. There are plenty of parks to walk the dog or take the kids to play with purpose built bike tracks and picturesque pathways through bushland and parks",

              lifestyle: "Overall Southern Suburbs is a sought after place to live. This is a great place to live and over the next few years there should be good capital growth for property owners. Southern Suburbs is a wonderful suburb, great easy access to Brisbane City and surrounded by amazing parklands, excellent schools, charming cafe's, bars and restaurants. No matter where you are in the suburb you are never far from everything you could possibly need. There are enough restaurants for a good way of lifestyle, cafes and bars along both Holland Road and Logan Road to keep us entertained and good bus access into town or South Bank (only ~6 km away). Good access to motorways and public transport including the new train station. Doctors, schools, babysitting are all nearby. Still plenty of units with a mix of heritage listed queenslanders, post-war and modern homes. Up towards Cav Road many of these are on elevated spots that catch great breezes and city or suburban views. With 100 businesses located in the Moorvale shopping area on Beaudesert Road, it’s easy to shop and eat locally. The African community has left its mark here too, with grocery stores, hairdressers and Halal butchers meeting the needs of the new locals. New cafes are popping up on street corners to make sure that this neighbourhood is well fed and caffeinated, without having to jump in the car. It's a great place to raise kids, good neighbours. Overall Southern Suburbs has a friendly community spirit where neighbours catch up at the letterbox or for street barbecues. Everyone is willing to lend a hand if one is needed and strangers will greet you while a smile and a “G'day”. There are plenty of parks to walk the dog or take the kids to play with purpose built bike tracks and picturesque pathways through bushland and parks",

              lifestyle: "Overall Southern Suburbs is a sought after place to live. This is a great place to live and over the next few years there should be good capital growth for property owners. Southern Suburbs is a wonderful suburb, great easy access to Brisbane City and surrounded by amazing parklands, excellent schools, charming cafe's, bars and restaurants. No matter where you are in the suburb you are never far from everything you could possibly need. There are enough restaurants for a good way of lifestyle, cafes and bars along both Holland Road and Logan Road to keep us entertained and good bus access into town or South Bank (only ~6 km away). Good access to motorways and public transport including the new train station. Doctors, schools, babysitting are all nearby. Still plenty of units with a mix of heritage listed queenslanders, post-war and modern homes. Up towards Cav Road many of these are on elevated spots that catch great breezes and city or suburban views. With 100 businesses located in the Moorvale shopping area on Beaudesert Road, it’s easy to shop and eat locally. The African community has left its mark here too, with grocery stores, hairdressers and Halal butchers meeting the needs of the new locals. New cafes are popping up on street corners to make sure that this neighbourhood is well fed and caffeinated, without having to jump in the car. It's a great place to raise kids, good neighbours. Overall Southern Suburbs has a friendly community spirit where neighbours catch up at the letterbox or for street barbecues. Everyone is willing to lend a hand if one is needed and strangers will greet you while a smile and a “G'day”. There are plenty of parks to walk the dog or take the kids to play with purpose built bike tracks and picturesque pathways through bushland and parks",

              lifestyle: "Overall Southern Suburbs is a sought after place to live. This is a great place to live and over the next few years there should be good capital growth for property owners. Southern Suburbs is a wonderful suburb, great easy access to Brisbane City and surrounded by amazing parklands, excellent schools, charming cafe's, bars and restaurants. No matter where you are in the suburb you are never far from everything you could possibly need. There are enough restaurants for a good way of lifestyle, cafes and bars along both Holland Road and Logan Road to keep us entertained and good bus access into town or South Bank (only ~6 km away). Good access to motorways and public transport including the new train station. Doctors, schools, babysitting are all nearby. Still plenty of units with a mix of heritage listed queenslanders, post-war and modern homes. Up towards Cav Road many of these are on elevated spots that catch great breezes and city or suburban views. With 100 businesses located in the Moorvale shopping area on Beaudesert Road, it’s easy to shop and eat locally. The African community has left its mark here too, with grocery stores, hairdressers and Halal butchers meeting the needs of the new locals. New cafes are popping up on street corners to make sure that this neighbourhood is well fed and caffeinated, without having to jump in the car. It's a great place to raise kids, good neighbours. Overall Southern Suburbs has a friendly community spirit where neighbours catch up at the letterbox or for street barbecues. Everyone is willing to lend a hand if one is needed and strangers will greet you while a smile and a “G'day”. There are plenty of parks to walk the dog or take the kids to play with purpose built bike tracks and picturesque pathways through bushland and parks",

              lifestyle: "Overall Southern Suburbs is a sought after place to live. This is a great place to live and over the next few years there should be good capital growth for property owners. Southern Suburbs is a wonderful suburb, great easy access to Brisbane City and surrounded by amazing parklands, excellent schools, charming cafe's, bars and restaurants. No matter where you are in the suburb you are never far from everything you could possibly need. There are enough restaurants for a good way of lifestyle, cafes and bars along both Holland Road and Logan Road to keep us entertained and good bus access into town or South Bank (only ~6 km away). Good access to motorways and public transport including the new train station. Doctors, schools, babysitting are all nearby. Still plenty of units with a mix of heritage listed queenslanders, post-war and modern homes. Up towards Cav Road many of these are on elevated spots that catch great breezes and city or suburban views. With 100 businesses located in the Moorvale shopping area on Beaudesert Road, it’s easy to shop and eat locally. The African community has left its mark here too, with grocery stores, hairdressers and Halal butchers meeting the needs of the new locals. New cafes are popping up on street corners to make sure that this neighbourhood is well fed and caffeinated, without having to jump in the car. It's a great place to raise kids, good neighbours. Overall Southern Suburbs has a friendly community spirit where neighbours catch up at the letterbox or for street barbecues. Everyone is willing to lend a hand if one is needed and strangers will greet you while a smile and a “G'day”. There are plenty of parks to walk the dog or take the kids to play with purpose built bike tracks and picturesque pathways through bushland and parks",

It is a world class place and a great asset to this community, and the organization works very closely with the residents to ensure that the community's opinion is supported. The lifestyle in this suburb is quiet and green, and is also within walking distance of the best cafes and bakery in Brisbane. Also within walking distance of the riverside playgrounds. There is a police station, many parks, good cafes, restaurants, doctors, pharmacies, swimming pools, gas stations and, of course, the highway leading to the north and south. It is also a great place to live if you love nature, with two separate bush walks and a Jamboree boat ramp with its own dog lover area. Your children will be able to attend schools, both public and private. The school is very easy and quick to get to as there are no transport problems in the area",

The lifestyle in this suburb is quiet and green, and is also within walking distance of the best cafes and bakery in Brisbane. Also within walking distance of the riverside playgrounds. There is a police station, many parks, good cafes, restaurants, doctors, pharmacies, swimming pools, gas stations and, of course, the highway leading to the north and south. It is also a great place to live if you love nature, with two separate bush walks and a Jamboree boat ramp with its own dog lover area. Your children will be able to attend schools, both public and private. The school is very easy and quick to get to as there are no transport problems in the area",

              lifestyle: "The lifestyle at Western Suburbs is all about enjoying the rural serenity — whether it's farming on your own small plot or enjoying the rural pleasures of horseback riding. Here is the Moggill Pony Club, one of the oldest in Brisbane, founded in 1960. Pullenvale Old School (built in 1874) has been converted into an open-air education center, allowing Queensland students to experience the area's rich flora and fauna. (including sugar gliders, mighty owls and deer). Buses run regularly along Moggill Road into the city and are the main form of public transport. In keeping with the rustic atmosphere, there are local shops in the area, but the main shopping village and supermarket are in Bellboury or Kenmore. There are tons of things to do in Western Suburbs. Including Hawken Drive, which is home to the local IGA and which offers a wide variety of restaurants ranging from Persian to Thai to Italian, there is a large selection of restaurants in one small lane! Hawken Drive is within walking distance of anywhere in Saint Lucia, and if you don't want to walk, numerous buses will get you there in no time! There is also the famous golf club St Lucia, the food is amazing too. There is also the famous University of Queensland, which has tennis courts, Olympic pools, running courses, many clubs for all ages, and more. These services are also available to everyone, but be aware that there is a small fee. If you want to go shopping, visit the huge Indooroopilly Mall and Toowong Village, which are 5 minutes away by car or bus. Western Suburbs is a very safe suburb. With a municipal patrol car that drives constantly, you can always have peace of mind",

              lifestyle: "The lifestyle at Western Suburbs is all about enjoying the rural serenity — whether it's farming on your own small plot or enjoying the rural pleasures of horseback riding. Here is the Moggill Pony Club, one of the oldest in Brisbane, founded in 1960. Pullenvale Old School (built in 1874) has been converted into an open-air education center, allowing Queensland students to experience the area's rich flora and fauna. (including sugar gliders, mighty owls and deer). Buses run regularly along Moggill Road into the city and are the main form of public transport. In keeping with the rustic atmosphere, there are local shops in the area, but the main shopping village and supermarket are in Bellboury or Kenmore. There are tons of things to do in Western Suburbs. Including Hawken Drive, which is home to the local IGA and which offers a wide variety of restaurants ranging from Persian to Thai to Italian, there is a large selection of restaurants in one small lane! Hawken Drive is within walking distance of anywhere in Saint Lucia, and if you don't want to walk, numerous buses will get you there in no time! There is also the famous golf club St Lucia, the food is amazing too. There is also the famous University of Queensland, which has tennis courts, Olympic pools, running courses, many clubs for all ages, and more. These services are also available to everyone, but be aware that there is a small fee. If you want to go shopping, visit the huge Indooroopilly Mall and Toowong Village, which are 5 minutes away by car or bus. Western Suburbs is a very safe suburb. With a municipal patrol car that drives constantly, you can always have peace of mind",

Now professionals and families can enjoy the relaxed atmosphere of North Western Suburbs every day of the week. As in the neighboring suburbs to the east, the neighborhoods have characteristic wooden houses, green streets and rolling hills. But unlike other suburbs, The Gap is surrounded by beautiful nature reserves with natural bushlands and national parks, making it the perfect bush getaway for jaded urban professionals. With a plethora of quality schools here and nearby, as well as a myriad of playgrounds, clubs, teams, bike paths and parks, even the pickiest kids will have a hard time getting bored in North Western Suburbs",

              lifestyle: "Outer Eastern (Bayside) Suburbs is an incredibly beautiful area. In a five minute drive, you will see yourself strolling along the marina and never miss out on everything the neighborhood has to offer in the form of parks and restaurants. In fact, if you choose to live in Outer Eastern, you will not only get closer to many sports facilities like the Active Arena, BMX track and many bike paths, but you will also get more direct access to the city. Housing is also considered to be more affordable. As the seasons come, you are greeted with a multitude of trees bursting with color and scent, from frangipes to the stunning jacaranda lining the roads and streets. Quiet lifestyle, feeling of a rustic town. So there are no big Westfields with David Jones or Mayer, but all the big supermarkets and boutiques. Take your kids down to the large park on the water, go for a bike ride or run across the bay. Enough restaurants to keep you happy and lots of fantastic takeaways. Housing prices are more affordable and the choice is great. You might think it is a little long to get to CBD (about 40 minutes), but the average person in Sydney travels the same distance every day",

In a five minute drive, you will see yourself strolling along the marina and never miss out on everything the neighborhood has to offer in the form of parks and restaurants. In fact, if you choose to live in Outer Eastern, you will not only get closer to many sports facilities like the Active Arena, BMX track and many bike paths, but you will also get more direct access to the city. Housing is also considered to be more affordable. As the seasons come, you are greeted with a multitude of trees bursting with color and scent, from frangipes to the stunning jacaranda lining the roads and streets. Quiet lifestyle, feeling of a rustic town. So there are no big Westfields with David Jones or Mayer, but all the big supermarkets and boutiques. Take your kids down to the large park on the water, go for a bike ride or run across the bay. Enough restaurants to keep you happy and lots of fantastic takeaways. Housing prices are more affordable and the choice is great.

              lifestyle: "Outer Eastern (Bayside) Suburbs is an incredibly beautiful area. In a five minute drive, you will see yourself strolling along the marina and never miss out on everything the neighborhood has to offer in the form of parks and restaurants. In fact, if you choose to live in Outer Eastern, you will not only get closer to many sports facilities like the Active Arena, BMX track and many bike paths, but you will also get more direct access to the city. Housing is also considered to be more affordable. As the seasons come, you are greeted with a multitude of trees bursting with color and scent, from frangipes to the stunning jacaranda lining the roads and streets. Quiet lifestyle, feeling of a rustic town. So there are no big Westfields with David Jones or Mayer, but all the big supermarkets and boutiques. Take your kids down to the large park on the water, go for a bike ride or run across the bay. Enough restaurants to keep you happy and lots of fantastic takeaways. Housing prices are more affordable and the choice is great. You might think it is a little long to get to CBD (about 40 minutes), but the average person in Sydney travels the same distance every day",

As far as connectivity goes, I don't know how you could beat it. To live there, you have to be passionate about the lifestyle on the square - there is hardly a block less than 10,000 square meters. M / 2.5 acres, and many are double or more. The houses are huge to match the land, and the whole area feels incredibly spacious and open. Wildlife is abundant. Social activities are not very active. This location is obviously a fairly expensive area, although prices have stabilized as the cropland lifestyle has gone out of style a little. There are many very good private schools in the eastern part of Brisbane and local public schools (like Hamdale) are pretty good",

Despite the layout of the squares, everything is close here too.

As far as connectivity goes, I don't know how you could beat it. To live there, you have to be passionate about the lifestyle on the square - there is hardly a block less than 10,000 square meters. M / 2.5 acres, and many are double or more. The houses are huge to match the land, and the whole area feels incredibly spacious and open. Wildlife is abundant. Social activities are not very active. This location is obviously a fairly expensive area, although prices have stabilized as the cropland lifestyle has gone out of style a little. There are many very good private schools in the eastern part of Brisbane and local public schools (like Hamdale) are pretty good",
