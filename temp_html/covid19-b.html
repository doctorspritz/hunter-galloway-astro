                <p>We are in uncharted territory. The global coronavirus pandemic is causing economic disruption on a massive scale. It is affecting every inch of our daily lives. The only thing that comes close is the 1918 influenza pandemic, but that was a very different time.</p>
                <p><span class="text-bold">Australian consumer confidence is at an all-time low, the share market is down, and economists are predicting that unemploment in Australia could reach up to 10 per cent.</span></p>
                <p>The world looks set to enter a recession, and things are going to be very different when it comes out the other side.</p>
                <p> And if you feel like things are going to get worse before they get better, you’re not alone. 85% of Australians recently surveyed by Roy Morgan say “the worst is yet to come” in regards to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.</p>
                <p>In times like these, it’s normal to feel uncertain about your financial future. A lot has happened in the past few weeks, and it can be a lot to process.</p>
                <p>Read on to learn about the potential effects of COVID-19 on your mortgage, and what you can do about it.</p>

                    <div class="risk_holder">
                        <p>Uncertainty is very high at the moment, and very few people are committing to a purchase. Real estate agents are reporting that buyer enquiry has fallen sharply.</p>
                        <p>Social distancing rules have banned property open houses, and auctions have had to move online. Since this happened at least 400 of the nearly 1260 auctions originally scheduled for the last week of March shifted to non-auction listings. Auction clearance rates are falling to near record lows, and look set to continue to fall.</p>
                        <p><span class="text-bold">Mortgage stress has increased, with over 200,000 households added to the stresed list. This figure is likely to rise as more businesses close and social distancing measures continue to ramp up.</span></p>
                        <p>AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver has predicted that unemployment will likely shoot up to about 10 per cent and this could result in a 20 per cent drop in Melbourne and Sydney house prices.</p>
                        <p>In the best-case scenario, capital cities are likely to see house price declines of about 5 per cent.</p>

                <p><span class="text-bold">The success or failure of Australia’s coronavirus fight relies to a large degree on just one thing: whether individual Australians follow official advise and just stay home.</span></p>
                <p>Coronavirus will continue to spread virtually unchecked unless at least 8 in 10 Australians stay home as much as possible. And the longer it takes to get the disease under control, the worse it will be for our economy.</p>
                <p>As far as the toll on our economy goes, we could see an impact lasting a decade or more. Recessions caused by financial crises, such as the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, can depress interest rates and economic activity for up to 10 years.</p>
                <p>And it could last even longer than that. Economists from the University of California researching the impact of historical pandemics found “significant macroeconomic after-effect” from pandemic that lasted for 40 years.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, if we get the disease under control quickly and the government continues to support our economy, growth could rebound quickly.</p>
                <p>The Australian government is doing what it can to minimise the long term impact of the pandemic,</p>
                <p>On 30 March, the government announced the $130 billion JobKeeper Payment to help keep Australians in jobs, bringing the Government’s total support for the economy to $320 billion, representing 16.4 per cent of annual GDP.</p>
                <p>Whether that will be enough is anyone’s guess.</p>
                <p>Our advice is to follow this mantra by Maya Angelou: <span class="text-bold text-italic">“Hoping for the best, prepared for the worst, and unsurprised by anything in between.”</span></p>

                                Refinancing refers to the process of changing your existing home loan for a new one. You can refinance your loan with your current lender, or more commonly, you transfer your loan to a new bank.

                        <div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
                            <p>When you take you a new home loan, you will use some or all of the funds from the new loan to pay out your current loan. Once you have paid off your existing loan, your mortgage with your current bank will be closed and you will start making repayments to your new lender.</p>
                            <p>In order to refinance your loan you will need to complete the following steps:</p>

                            <ul class="inner_list inner_list_digit">
                                <li> Shop around for a new loan (or save yourself the trouble and have one of our friendly mortgage brokers shop around for you). Once you find the right lender and the right home loan, you will start the application process.</li>
                                <li> When you begin the application process, the lender will complete an initial assessment to make sure that you can afford the new loan. They will want to take a look at supporting documentation such as payslips and your current home loan statements. Once completed, assuming that you qualify, they will issue a conditional approval for your loan.</li>
                                <li> Next, the bank may order a property valuation. This valuation will determine how much you can borrow and whether your property is an acceptable security for the loan.</li>
                                <li> Once the valuation and any other conditions have been reviewed, the bank will unconditionally approve your loan and send contracts for you to sign and return. </li>
                                <li> The bank will contact your previous lender to arrange a changeover of the loan once they receive your signed contracts. This changeover process is called settlement and occurs on a date mutually agreed upon by the banks. </li>
                                <li> On settlement day, your old loan will be paid out and the title of the property will be handed over to your new lender.</li>
                                <li> Once settlement is complete, you will start making repayments to your new bank. </li>

                            <p>Absolutely. Many borrowers refinance their loans at a higher loan amount. You can use this to fund other expenses, such as renovations, holidays, a new car, or debt consolidation. </p>
                            <p>You can typically borrow up to 80% of the value of your property. For example, if your property is worth $650,000 and your loan amount is $450,000, you could borrow up to an additional $70,000 (bringing your new loan amount up to $520,000 which is 80% of your property’s value).</p>

                            <ul class="inner_list">
                                <li><span class="text-bold">Loan Application Fee:</span> Applicable by the lender when applying for a new loan.</li>
                                <li><span class="text-bold">Exit Fees/Break Costs:</span> Although earlier termination fees were abolished in 2011, lenders will charge an exit fee/break cost for fixed rate loans that are still in their fixed term. The fee is calculated by the lender on a daily basis – based on the fixed rate, the variable rate, loan balance and remaining term.</li>
                                <li><span class="text-bold">Valuation Fee:</span>  Your lender may charge a fee to have your property valued.</li>
                                <li><span class="text-bold">Settlement Fee:</span> Your lender may charge a fee to pay out your current mortgage.</li>
                                <li><span class="text-bold">Discharge Fee:</span> Most lenders will charge $150 – $400 to discharge your loan</li>
                                <li><span class="text-bold">Mortgage Registration (Government Fee):</span> The land titles office will charge a mortgage deregistration and registration fee. This is to register the mortgage on the title.</li>
                                <li><span class="text-bold">Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI):</span> One-off fee only applicable if you have more than 80% of the purchase price owing on your home loan refinance.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>You can refinance your home loan from any bank or lender you choose, including your existing bank. These days we find that banks do not typically reward loyalty. In most cases we find lenders offer better deals to new customers rather than rewarding existing ones.</p>
                            <p>That being said, we are often able to negotiate a better rate for you even if you choose to stay with your existing bank.</p>

                            <p>The banks will have a professional valuer complete a valuation report on your property as part of the refinance process. They give the property a value that the lender uses in their calculations as well as providing information about the property and the market conditions in the area. You won’t know all of this until the report is completed.</p>
                            <p>You can get an idea about what your property is worth by doing your own research:</p>

                                <li>Look at sales of similar properties in your suburb in the past 6 months</li>
                                <li>Look at websites such as realestate.com.au or domain.com.au for recent sales history</li>
                                <li>Speak to local real estate agents about activity in your area</li>
                                <li>Compare your property with other similar properties. They should have similar construction, land size, number of bedrooms and improvements.</li>

                            <p>If the outstanding balance of your loan is higher than 80% of your property’s value you may need to pay LMI with your new lender. LMI is not transferable between lenders, so if you refinance to another lender, if your loan is not below 80%, it will be payable again.</p>
                            <p>If your loan amount is below 80% you will not need to pay LMI again.</p>

                <p>Award winning Mortgage Broker in Brisbane</p>
                <p>As members of the Financial Brokers Association of Australia (FBAA) and the Credit and Investments Ombudsman (CIO) we must uphold the highest level of excellence when helping clients with their finances. The members of each organisation must meet a minimum standard in experience, education and ongoing training to maintain membership each year and as active members, we commit to upholding these standards, ensuring we maintain their high levels of compliance, integrity, and professionalism with all of our mortgage clients.</p>

                <h3 class="inner_title">Valuation issues & credit scores</h3>
                <p>One of the most common issues we see is with valuations and shortfalls which can ultimately stop your property journey before it even begins. We can order free upfront valuations with many of our lenders, meaning we can find out what your bank thinks your property is worth way before applying with them.</p>
                <p> From experience, we know that ordering a valuation prior to applying for a home loan makes sure your credit file doesn’t get damaged from having multiple enquiries.</p>
                <p>We can provide free valuations and also a copy of your credit file so you know where you stand way before applying for a loan with the banks!</p>

                <h3 class="inner_title">Complex Credit Policy Pitfalls</h3>
                <p>Each lender and bank in Australia has a unique credit policy, meaning while some will accept your full income, others may not allow it due to their policy.</p>
                <p>Quite often bank policy can be set in stone, and due to the complexity bank staff quite honestly don’t know it nor do many mortgage broker Brisbane. They are not familiar with complex situations and how to correctly assess them. This can sometimes cause it to take quite a long time to process your application and even in some instances mean your loan will get declined for no good reason.</p>
                <p>With banks making their policies more and more complex it becomes more important to correctly package, and assess your application before it is even lodged with the bank – showing the banks all of the strengths of your home loan application and making sure it fits all of their policies.</p>
                <p>At Hunter Galloway we have our own in-house credit team and we make sure your application is going to fit with the bank each time.</p>
