                        <p>The advantage for you is that unlike when dealing with one bank, we can help you work with a wider variety of lenders and get the best options that work for you choosing from our panel of over 30 banks and lenders!</p>

                                <li>80 percent of the Property Price – If you borrow 80 percent of the total value of a property, you may not be required to pay LMI. But you will need to show a 20 percent deposit, for example, you need to have $200,000 as a deposit amount if you wish to borrow $1,000,000 at an 80 percent loan to value ratio.</li>
                                <li>85 percent of the Property Price – Lending criteria will not be strict and LMI can be waived for Nurses if you wish to take a loan of 85 percent of the property price based on the criteria below.</li>
                                <li>90 percent of the Property Price – If you are able to meet the requirements of a lender, you can also get a 90 percent loan to value ratio. For that, you must repay the debt on a timely basis, must have a 10 percent deposit, stable job and income stream, and good credit history.</li>
                                <li>95 percent of the Property Price – To qualify for a 95 percent loan to value ratio, you need to have a reasonable salary, stable job, good credit history, minimal debt, and you should not be purchasing an unusual type of property in a distant location.</li>
                                <li>More than 95 percent Loan to Value Ratio – If you go for Guarantor home loans, there is also a possibility of getting a home loan that equals 105 percent of the property value. It allows you to avoid LMI payments and you do not even have to fulfill any deposit requirements.

                            <p>So many lenders consider nurses to be low-risk professionals. This is the reason why most nurse practitioners qualify for waived LMI.</p>
                            <p>To qualify for over 80 percent, however, you have to meet additional requirements that are as follows:</p>

                            <ul class="inner_list">
                                <li>The borrowing amount should not exceed 85 percent loan to value ratio</li>
                                <li>The loan size should not be more than $1,500,000</li>
                                <li>You hold a good credit rating, with no defaults</li>
                                <li>You have a stable job and a reasonable stream of income</li>
                                <li>You have been in your current job for over 2 years</li>
                                <li>You are looking at purchasing a home</li>

                            <p>It can be a little bit more challenging to get a home loan on probation, but it is still possible.
                                You may still be able to borrow up to 95% of the property value as long as you meet all other standard bank lending criteria. This includes having a clean credit history.</p>
                            <p>We recommend applying for a home loan only if you’re certain that your employment is stable.</p>

                        <div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
                            <p>Lenders will typically consider only 50-80% of overtime income for regular borrowers, which can significantly reduce your borrowing power. Since nurses are essential services workers, some lenders will accept 100% of your overtime income.</p>
                            <p>In order to have 100% of your overtime income considered, you’ll need to provide the following:</p>
                            <ul class="inner_list">
                                <li>An employment letter confirming that you have been receiving overtime income regularly for the past one or two years</li>

                            <p>In many cases, nurses receive a portion of their income in the form of fringe benefits. Many lenders make the mistake of including your fringe benefits as taxable income. This can greatly reduce the amount you’re eligible to borrow.</p>
                            <p>Luckily, there are some lenders that consider this income as tax-free income. Talk to one of our friendly brokers at Hunter Galloway to find out which lenders will do this for you.</p>

                            <p>Of course! Being a nurse, it is very common to have a second job to increase your income. This can be from another hospital, or even in another field like aged care or as a trainer.</p>
                            <p>If you can show that you have a 6-12 month work history with your second employer and have been earning a regular income, some lenders will accept 100% of your second job income. Otherwise, they may only consider 50-80% of your second job income.</p>

                <p>Award winning Mortgage Broker in Brisbane</p>
                <p>As members of the Financial Brokers Association of Australia (FBAA) and the Credit and Investments Ombudsman (CIO) we must uphold the highest level of excellence when helping clients with their finances. The members of each organisation must meet a minimum standard in experience, education and ongoing training to maintain membership each year and as active members, we commit to upholding these standards, ensuring we maintain their high levels of compliance, integrity, and professionalism with all of our mortgage clients.</p>

                <h3 class="inner_title">Valuation issues & credit scores</h3>
                <p>One of the most common issues we see is with valuations and shortfalls which can ultimately stop your property journey before it even begins. We can order free upfront valuations with many of our lenders, meaning we can find out what your bank thinks your property is worth way before applying with them.</p>
                <p> From experience, we know that ordering a valuation prior to applying for a home loan makes sure your credit file doesn’t get damaged from having multiple enquiries.</p>
                <p>We can provide free valuations and also a copy of your credit file so you know where you stand way before applying for a loan with the banks!</p>

                <h3 class="inner_title">Complex Credit Policy Pitfalls</h3>
                <p>Each lender and bank in Australia has a unique credit policy, meaning while some will accept your full income, others may not allow it due to their policy.</p>
                <p>Quite often bank policy can be set in stone, and due to the complexity bank staff quite honestly don’t know it nor do many mortgage broker Brisbane. They are not familiar with complex situations and how to correctly assess them. This can sometimes cause it to take quite a long time to process your application and even in some instances mean your loan will get declined for no good reason.</p>
                <p>With banks making their policies more and more complex it becomes more important to correctly package, and assess your application before it is even lodged with the bank – showing the banks all of the strengths of your home loan application and making sure it fits all of their policies.</p>
                <p>At Hunter Galloway we have our own in-house credit team and we make sure your application is going to fit with the bank each time.</p>
