                            <p>As a medical professional you are able to borrow much higher amounts than the general public. Doctors, dentists, and allied health professionals have a great reputation with banks thanks to a high earning potential and a low risk of default.</p>
                            <p>Your exact borrowing capacity depends on your unique financial situation, so it’s best to talk to one of our expert mortgage brokers to find out exactly how much you can borrow.</p>
                            <p>Here are some guidelines:</p>
                            <ul class="inner_list">
                                <li>Borrow up to 95% of the property’s value and pay no LMI (largest range of lenders, less strict criteria)</li>
                                <li>Borrow up to $5 million to purchase a home to live in, or investment property</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In other words, if you are buying a $1 million home, you do not need any deposit and only require some savings to cover stamp duty costs.</p>
                            <p>If the property is valued over $5 million and above, we have access to lenders and banks that will review your situation on a case by case basis</p>

                            <p>Yes you are! Self-employed dentists are eligible for <a href="/lenders-mortgage-insurance/">home loans without LMI</a> and your tax returns will be evidence to prove this. However, if this isn’t a possible document then invoices can be used as evidence of income. Lenders are looking at your ability to repay the loan and it certainly isn’t the first time a self-employed professional has asked for a loan.</p>

                            <p>However, due to this, they can sometimes be looked at with an air of caution by lenders, as the income level is not stable and there’s a higher chance of default. A way to get around this is to show regular and stable income for an extended period. Anything from 2 years + will cover this.</p>

                            <p>In order to receive benefits that dentists recieve such as waived Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI) or interest rate discounts, you need to be a member of the <a href="https://www.ada.org.au/">Australian Dental Association (ADA)</a> or the <a href="https://www.adc.org.au/"> Australian Dental Council (ADC)</a>.</p>

                <h3 class="text_title text_underline"><span id="how-much-borrow">How much can I borrow?</span></h3>
                <p><span>As a Doctor or Medical Professional, you can borrow much higher amounts than the regular public.</span></p>
                <p><span>This is because the banks see your profession as a much lower risk than the general population</span></p>
                <p><span>You can:</span></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span><img class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/svg/2705.svg" alt="✅" />&nbsp;Borrow up to 100% LVR and pay no LMI (slightly harder lending criteria applies)</span></li>
                    <li><span><img class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/svg/2705.svg" alt="✅" />&nbsp;Borrow up to 90% of the property’s value and pay no LMI (largest range of lenders, less strict criteria)</span></li>
                    <li><span><img class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/svg/2705.svg" alt="✅" />&nbsp;Borrow up to $4.5 million to purchase a home to live in or investment property.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span>In other words, if you are buying a $1 million home, you do not need any deposit and only require some savings to cover stamp duty costs.</span></p>
                <p><span>If the property is valued at over $5 million, we have lenders and banks that will look at these on a case by case basis.</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <!-- Step 2 -->

                <p><span>Not all medical professionals are eligible for the same <a href="/home-loans-for-doctors/">doctor home loans</a>. Some, including naturopaths, psychologists and medical research scientists, won’t be able to access the same concessions.</span></p>
                <p><span>The major banks have identified these medical streams as less stable and higher risk. However, it’s not all bad news. Even if you don’t qualify for the same benefits as other medical professionals, you might still be able to negotiate a lower interest rate—especially if you have decent employment history and significant savings!</span></p>

                <h4 class="text_subtitle"><strong>Why do the banks waive LMI?</strong></h4>
                <p>The average person usually has to pay <a href="/lmi-calculator/">lenders mortgage insurance (LMI)</a> if they borrow more than 80% of the value of the property they&rsquo;re buying.</p>
                <p><a href="/lmi-calculator/">LMI</a>&nbsp;is a once-off fee that insures banks against losses in cases where you can&rsquo;t repay your mortgage.</p>
                <p>However, medical professionals are seen as low-risk borrowers and don’t usually have to pay <a href="/lmi-calculator/">LMI</a>. Doctors rarely miss mortgage repayments because of their high income and good employment prospects.</p>
                <p>Home loans for doctors and other medical professionals can also come with other perks that aren’t available to the general public.</p>
                <p>For example, a young medical professional may be able to borrow up to 105% of the value of their property if their parents are willing to act as <a href="/guarantor-home-loan/">guarantors</a>.</p>

                <p>The average person will be forced to pay huge amounts of <a href="/lmi-calculator/">LMI</a> on luxury properties. LMI premiums skyrocket on purchases over $1 million.</p>

                <p>Natalie and Shaun are both Doctors who have been working for the past few years. Natalie has recently been promoted in her work and received a significant income boost.</p>
                <p>They were both renting and had enough savings to cover their stamp duty but didn’t have any deposit.</p>
                <p>They found the perfect home for $1.25M and wanted to purchase it without going down the <a href="/guarantor-home-loan/">guarantor home loan</a> path.</p>

                <p><a href="/">Hunter Galloway</a>&nbsp;we were able to source 100%, No-LMI finance for them, meaning they could borrow the full $1.250M towards the home purchase.</p>
                <p>This was structured:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>&ndash; 90% Home Loan over 30 years = $1.1250M loan</li>
                    <li>&ndash; 10% Top up loan over 8 years = $0.125M loan</li>
                    <li>&ndash; Total lending $1.250M</li>
                </ul>
                <p>With Natalie&rsquo;s new job, she expects to pay off the top-up loan within 3 years.</p>

                <h3 class="text_title text_underline" id='maximize-interest'><strong>How To Maximize Your Interest Rate Discounts.</strong></h3>
                <p>In this section, we talk about saving you some serious cash.</p>
                <h4 class="text_subtitle"><strong>Why do Doctors get discounted interest rates?</strong></h4>
                <p>As a doctor, you’re a very attractive prospect for lenders. Most medical professionals have a high income and good job prospects, making them very low-risk borrowers.</p>
                <p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Home-Loans-for-Doctors-Australia.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 798px) 100vw, 798px" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Home-Loans-for-Doctors-Australia.jpg 798w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Home-Loans-for-Doctors-Australia-300x202.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Home-Loans-for-Doctors-Australia-768x516.jpg 768w" alt="Home Loans for Doctors Australia" width="798" height="536" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>This has resulted in numerous lenders creating special home loans for doctors. Our medical mortgage broker team can help you negotiate a reduced interest rate and <a href="/lmi-calculator/">no LMI</a>.</p>
                <p>If you’re buying a property worth $900,000, you could save up to $25,000 on LMI. Similarly, you might not need a deposit, which means that you won’t need a huge amount of available capital to purchase a relatively expensive property.</p>

                </ul>

                <h3 class="text_title text_underline" id='income-acceptable'><span><strong>What income is considered acceptable?</strong></span></h3>
                <p><span>Doctors and other medical professionals can sometimes have strange income structures that banks don’t like. This can include things like being self-employed or partnership style businesses.</span></p>
                <p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/home-loans-for-medical-professionals.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 801px) 100vw, 801px" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/home-loans-for-medical-professionals.jpg 801w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/07/home-loans-for-medical-professionals-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/07/home-loans-for-medical-professionals-768x512.jpg 768w" alt="home loans for medical professionals" width="801" height="534" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span>Likewise, medical professionals often work as contractors or subcontractors. This means that they work as needed and earn according to their workload.</span></p>
                <p><span>Just because you’re a contractor or are self-employed doesn’t mean that lenders will reject you.</span></p>
                <p><span>Our medical <a href="/mortgage-broker-brisbane/">Brisbane Mortgage Brokers</a> will help you get the best home loan for doctors. You shouldn’t have any problems as long as you can prove that you have a regular, ongoing income.</span></p>

                <p>In this section, we’ll share the tactics we use to find the right lender for you.</p>
                <p>When you find the right lender that fits with you, you’ll usually find you will receive a sharper interest rate and better terms.</p>
                <p>Every lender has a different approach to mortgages for doctors, including the type of properties they specialize in and how they will verify your income.</p>
                <p>All lenders’ policies are constantly changing, so it’s hard to give a broad-brushed ‘this lender will be right for you’ answer here.</p>
                <p>In other words, each application and situation is unique.</p>

                                    <h4 class="text_subtitle">Interest Only Home Loans</h4>
                                    <p>An interest-only home loan allows the borrower to only make interest payments for the first few years without any increase in the principal amount.</p>
                                    <p>However, once the interest-only term period is over, they are required to make both principal and interest repayments.</p>
                                    <p>Regulatory authorities in the industry have imposed stringent policies encouraging banks to slow down on interest-only home loans. But you can still qualify for one, depending on the following factors:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><span ><img class="emoji"  role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/svg/2705.svg" alt="✅" />&nbsp;Purpose of a loan</span></li>

                                    </ul>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Interest-only home loans are normally beneficial for real estate investors who want to improve their cash flow and are looking for a buffer period during which they can invest money in building a house or for other purposes.</p>
                                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                    <h4 class="text_subtitle">How do Interest Only Loans Work?</h4>
                                    <p>When you apply for this loan type, lenders do not consider the interest-only term period while calculating your borrowing power. For example, if your loan term is 20 years, with 3 years of interest-only payments, the lender will assess your borrowing power on a 17-year loan term.</p>
                                    <p>Since the interest-only repayments are small, most banks do not allow fortnightly or weekly payments. Instead, you are required to make monthly interest repayments. </p>
                                    <p>While you get immediate cost savings with an interest-only home loan by paying small repayment amounts—once your interest-only period is over, you will still owe the same principal amount as you did in the beginning, unlike a standard loan.</p>

                                    <h3 class="text_title text_underline"><strong >What is the regular process of getting a mortgage for Doctors?</strong></h3>
                                    <p >Most Doctors will go back to the bank they’ve always banked with—CBA, Westpac, and all the regulars. There is nothing wrong with this if you have a big deposit and want to pay whatever interest rate they decide to offer.</p>
                                    <p >However…</p>

                                    <p ><span >As we have mentioned, the banks’ method to review Home Loans for Doctors can sometimes be complicated, depending on your income source and if you are relying on future (potential) earnings.</span></p>
                                    <p ><span >So determining which lender is right for you really comes down to what you want to achieve and then matching that outcome with a bank or lender that specializes in that market niche.</span></p>
                                    <p ><span >It is critical that as a Doctor or Specialist, you don’t just fill out a bank application form and email your paperwork.</span></p>

                        <p >Doctors are low-risk borrowers with great incomes; therefore, they receive great discounts and rates. They are favoured due to their low default rate in comparison to any other profession. Due to this, they receive a number of benefits.</p>

                        <p>The best way to answer this question is through an example:</p>
                        <p >You’re a self-employed dentist running your own clinic for the past five years. Your income is sitting at around $120,000 per annum, with savings sitting in your bank at $200,000. You’re ready to buy and are considering a 2 bedroom home for around $670,000. What are your options, and will you have to pay LMI? Will you be eligible for waived LMI? Let’s do the maths.</p>

                        <p >Self-employed doctors or dentists are eligible for&nbsp;<a  href="/avoid-lenders-mortgage-insurance/">home loans without LMI</a>&nbsp;and your tax returns will be evidence to prove this.</p>
                        <p >However, if it isn’t possible to show your tax returns, then invoices can be used as evidence of income. Lenders are looking at your ability to repay the loan, and it certainly isn’t the first time a self-employed professional has asked for a loan.</p>
                        <p>However, if you are self-employed, lenders can sometimes look at you with an air of caution, as the income level is not stable, and there’s a higher chance of default. One way to get around this is to show regular and stable income for an extended period. Anything from 2 years + will cover this.</p>
                        <p >In order to receive benefits that dentists receive, such as waived Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI) or interest rate discounts, you need to be a member of the&nbsp;<a  href="https://www.ada.org.au/">Australian Dental Association</a>&nbsp;(ADA) or the&nbsp;<a  href="https://www.adc.org.au/">Australian Dental Council (ADC).</a></p>

                        <h3 class="text_title text_underline"><span >5. Can I get an interest-only doctor loan with no LMI?</span></h3>
                        <p >When it comes to providing a home loan to doctors, you can get a loan of up to 100% of the property price and avoid paying the cost of the lender’s mortgage insurance (LMI). </p>
                        <p >Not only that, but you can also get significant discounts on interest rates. The reason behind it is simple. You are high-income earners and usually take out loans for investment purposes.</p>
                        <p>And to answer your question as to whether you can get an interest-only doctor home loan with no LMI?</p>
                        <p ><span >The answer is YES, you can.&nbsp;<img class="emoji"  role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/svg/2705.svg" alt="✅" /></span></p>
                        <p >However, there are certain things you have to consider before getting an interest-only doctor home loan….</p>

                        <h3 class="text_title text_underline"><span >6. Can I get No LMI with an Interest Only Investment loan?</span></h3>
                        <p >Being able to get no LMI and interest-only Doctor Home Loan comes down to the purpose of the loan.</p>
                        <p >If you intend to get an interest-only doctor home loan for&nbsp;<span >investment purposes</span>&nbsp;and also get an LMI waiver, this is completely fine. You will save a lot of money on LMI, and it will give you huge cash flow benefits for future investments.</p>
                        <p >On the other hand, the banks do not like giving Interest-only Doctor Home Loans if you are buying a property to live in (also known as an owner-occupied home). However, if, for example, you were planning on turning the property into an investment within a few months of moving in, they may consider it.</p>
                        <p >There are many options for Doctors and medical professionals when it comes to getting a home loan, and at Hunter Galloway, we can help, so&nbsp;<a class='rc_open pum-trigger' href="/free-assessment/">talk to our team and see how we can help.</a></p>

                        <p >The savings can be made via lenders insurance (LMI) by showing that you have a stable and consistent income as a nurse. </p>
                        <p>As lenders believe nurses are low-risk professionals, they can qualify for over 80% LVR loans.</p>

                        <p >When partners are applying for a home loan together, the eligibility of receiving the benefits is not based on both borrowers being employed in the health profession. At least one of you must be a doctor or dentist, and then the LMI premium can be waived.</p>
